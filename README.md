# Markov Decision Process
This repository contains code from my blog post titled [Reinforcement Learning Explained: Markov Decision Processes](https://www.daniel-bethell.dev/reinforcement-learning/reinforcement-learning-explained-markov-decision-processes).

### Introduction
This repository contains the following files:
* `mdp.py` - The MDP class itself with various helper functions to play around with.
* `main.py` - The main Python file where an example MDP has been created with various tests already made. The example MDP is the same as found in the image.
* `MDP Example.png` - An example MDP that is also used to test the base class.

### The Example MDP
The example MDP was built to showcase all features of an MDP in a small version. For example, transitions can have a guaranteed probability of reach *s'* or a stochastic transition can exist.
